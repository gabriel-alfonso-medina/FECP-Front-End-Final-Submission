#Kusina ni Medina

Kusina ni Medina is a rudimentary Cookbook Application that provides users with an abundance of different recipes to try. The application contains the following features:
1. Home Page - Includes recommended recipes
2. Featured Cuisines
3. Item Search Capabilities
4. About Me Page

This project was born out of my passion for the culinary arts with the goal of inspiring others to start their culinary journey as well.
